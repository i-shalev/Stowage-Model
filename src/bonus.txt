1. In case of some errors on the same file we get all the errors and report them together.
for example you can see 'duplicateXY' and 'onePort' scenarios.

2. In case there are more than 1 file of 'ship_plan' or 'route' we give appropriate error message and
continue with one of the files.
for example you can see '2filesForEachType' scenario.

3. In case the output folder is not exist and can be created we create the folder. 
In case the path is to object that is not a folder (for example 1.txt) we give appropriate error message
to general_errors and use the current directory.
for example try give invalid parameter in the command line.

4. In case the algorithm path is not exist we know to identify that and write to the general_errors file appropriate error message.
In case the algorithm path exsist but don't contain .so files we print the error that there no .so files in the folder.
Because we belive that was honest mistake and he just forgot to add them, so it easier to see that on the screen.
for example try give invalid parameter in the command line and valid path to empty folder.

5. We tried as much as we can to not let the simulation to crush in case of a crush in the algorithm,
for example you can see 'badAlgoNotFound' scenario.


scenarios:

2filesForEachType:
Run our simulation and algorithm with the travel folder '2filesForEachType'.
Then go for the errors folder and check the algoName_2filesForEachType.errors file.

duplicateXY:
Run our simulation and algorithm with the travel folder 'duplicateXY'.
In the ship_plan file there are 2 lines with the same x,y different data(fatal error for the travel).
But we report all the errors we collected.
After run the simulation on that folder go to the errors folder and check the algoName_duplicateXY.errors file.

onePort:
Run our simulation and algorithm with the travel folder 'onePort'.
In the route file there are only one legal port name(fatal error for the travel).
But we report all the errors we collected.
After run the simulation on that folder go to the errors folder and check the algoName_onePort.errors file.

badAlgoNotFound:
The folder conatins an algorithm that cause crush but it write it to a the error file.
Just run the algorithm on simulation with any travel.
