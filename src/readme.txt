Our main folder contains the sub folders:
1. Algo
2. Common
3. Simulation

In order to build our algorithms .so files, simply move to Algo folder and run 'make' command.
In order to build our simulation project, simply move to Simulation folder and run 'make' command.
After the simulator created, you can run it (expect arguments like mentioned in the requirements)
